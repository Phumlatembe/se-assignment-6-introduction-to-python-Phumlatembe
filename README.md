# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
 -Python is programming language and its key feature which makes it popular is easy to read and use/learn. For example python is uded and is effective in analytics, game development and web development just name a few.
2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
- To install pyhton is pretty straight forward you can visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the package keeping in mind what operating system you are using than you can install it into your computer an if you want to see if it is installed sucessfuly you can go to your terminal window and write the command python -v to check if it shows up. 
3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
    - print("Hello, World!") print is a statement that tells the computer what to do, () is part of the syntax where you can write your desired data, "Hello, World!" is a string which is a data type.
4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
- Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType
data types used as variables in the code:
x= "Hello, World", or x = 20  just as examples  
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
- Conditional statements and loops in pyhton are used to execute the code until it meets the stated conditions. for example  we have variables a = 20, and b= 15 we can use if a>b print ("a is bigger than b") else print ("b is bigger than a") so this code is trying to check if a is bigger than b or not and if the conditions are met it will print out the correct statement. For loop example alphabets =["b", "j", "v"] for x in alphabets: print(x) this will return all the alphabets in the array.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
-A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called, this limit the repeatation of code  for example def my_function( x, y): print(x + y) and to call the function you can write my_function (5,6) and it will return 11.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable and dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. for example mylist =[23, 16, 54, 34] and dictionary thisdict={
   "Sandy": 23, "Andy": 16, "Rob": 54, "Ruby":34
}.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
- Python exceptions that can be raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred") since x is not defined this an error so the code will print out that statement finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished") this will execute even if there is no error.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
-a module to be the same as a code library file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application. you can import modules by using for example import mymodule statement for example  import math

x = math.sqrt(64)

print(x)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
- "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist and "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist for example assuming we a have some test saved in mygreeting.txt if we want to read it in the console we f = open("mygreeting.txt", "r") 
print(f.read()) and

 f = open("mygreeting.txt", "a")
f.write("Hello, from South Africa!")
f.close() we use this to write content into our file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
